# Hi, I’m Bhavesh 👋

I’m a **Full-Stack Engineer with a strong backend and system-design mindset**.  
I enjoy building production-grade systems end-to-end — from architecture to deployment — with a focus on scalability, reliability, and clean design.

I think beyond tasks and features.  
I think in terms of **products, platforms, and long-term maintainability**.
